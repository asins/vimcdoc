安装                                         *bufexplorer-installation*

安装步骤:
  - 下载 bufexplorer.zip
  - 将压缩包解压到你的 runtime 路径下(译注：Windows:$VIM/vimfiles, Linux:.vim/)
    此压缩包包含了 plugin/bufexplorer.vim 和 doc/bufexplorer.txt
  - 启动Vim 或 切换到 正在运行的 Vim
  - 执行以下命令
>
      :helptag <your runtime directory>/doc
<
译注：Windows: >
    :helptag $VIM/vimfiles/doc
<
Linux: >
    :helptag .vim/doc
<
    这个命令会为doc目录下的任何文件生成帮助标签。

==============================================================================
使用                                                      *bufexplorer-usage*

要在当前窗口中打开，使用： >
 \be   或   :BufExplorer   或    你映射的定义键
在新的水平分割的窗口中打开，使用: >
 \bs   或   :BufExplorerHorizontalSplit   或    你映射的定义键
在新的垂直分割的窗口中打开，使用： >
 \bv   或   :BufExplorerVerticalSplit   或    你映射的定义键

如果你想用其他键替换 '\'，只要简单地设置 leader 就可以了（查看 |mapleader| ）

注意: 如果启动 bufexplorer 时当前的 buffer 有改动, 当前的 window 总是会被分割，
bufexplorer 会在新的分割出来的 window 中显示


启动 bufexplorer 后可用下列命令:

 <F1>          切换帮助信息。
 <enter>       在当前 window 中打开光标所处的行的 buffer。
 <leftmouse>   在当前 window 中打开鼠标所指的行的 buffer。
 <shift-enter> 在别的 tab 中打开当前当标所处的行的 buffer。
 B             Works in association with the|ShowTabBuffer|option.  If
               |ShowTabBuffer|is set to 1, this toggles if BufExplorer is to
               only store the most recent tab for this buffer or not.
 D             |:delete| 从列表里关闭当前光标下的 buffer, buffer 的 buflisted
               选项被清空，可以通过 'show unlisted' 命令来重新显示这个 buffer。
 d             |:wipeout| 从列表里删除当前光标下的 buffer。当一个 buffer 被清除，
               即使 unlisted buffer 被显示，这个 buffer 也不会出现。
 f             切换 在选中 buffer 时，在当前窗口中打开 buffer，还是在活动窗口
               (原 buffer 打开的窗口)中打开 buffer。
 o             在当前窗口中打开光标下的 buffer。
 p             切换 文件路径 是否按 文件名/路径 来显示。
 q             退出 bufexplore。
 r             反转 buffer 列表的顺序。
 R             切换 相对路径/绝对路径。
 s             选择buffer列表的排序方式，可以是 buffer 的序号(buffer number)，
               文件名，扩展名，最近最多使用(MRU)，或者文件全路径。
 S             Cycle thru how the buffers are listed, in reverse order.
               Either by buffer number, file name, file extension, most
               recently used (MRU), or full path.
 T             切换 是否只显示本 tab 的 buffer。
 t             在新的 tab 页打开光标下的 buffer。
 t             在另外的tab中打开光标下的 buffer。
 u             切换 是否显示 "unlisted" buffer。


一旦被调用，bufexploer 会排序显示一个当前被打开的所有的 buffer 的列
表(按MRU排序)，你可以移动光标到包含你想要操作的 buffer 的名称的行上，
选中 buffer 后，你可以打开，关闭(delete)这个 buffer，或重排列表，反向排
序列表，退出浏览 等等 ...

更新历史                                                *bufexplorer-changelog*

7.3.0  - It has been quite a while since I published a new version and this
         is the first version since Vim 7.3 was released.
         * Thanks to Tim Johnson for testing out this new version.
         * I have put some time into reworking and cleaning up the code as
         * well as various bug fixes.
         * I have hopefully allowed for better mapping of the main public
           methods as is explained in the|bufexplorer-customization|section
           of the documentation.
         * Add new 'B', 'o', and 'S' key mappings.
         * Overall, I am hopeful that I not forgotten or lost a feature.
7.2.8  - Enhancements:
         * Thanks to Charles Campbell for integrating bufexplorer with GDBMGR.
           http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#GDBMGR
7.2.7  - Fix:
         * My 1st attempt to fix the "cache" issue where buffers information
           has changed but the cache/display does not reflect those changes.
           More work still needs to be done.
7.2.6  - Fix:
         * Thanks to Michael Henry for pointing out that I totally forgot to
           update the inline help to reflect the previous change to the 'd'
           and 'D' keys. Opps!
7.2.5  - Fix:
         * Philip Morant suggested switching the command (bwipe) associated
           with the 'd' key with the command (bdelete) associated with the 'D'
           key. This made sense since the 'd' key is more likely to be used
           compared to the 'D' key.
7.2.4  - Fix:
         * I did not implement the patch provided by Godefroid Chapelle
           correctly. I missed one line which happened to be the most
           important one :)
7.2.3  - Enhancements:
         * Thanks to David Fishburn for helping me out with a much needed
           code overhaul as well as some awesome performance enhancements.
           He also reworked the handling of tabs.
         * Thanks to Vladimir Dobriakov for making the suggestions on
           enhancing the documentation to include a better explaination of
           what is contained in the main bufexplorer window.
         * Thanks to Yuriy Ershov for added code that when the bufexplorer
           window is opened, the cursor is now positioned at the line with the
           active buffer (useful in non-MRU sort modes).
         * Yuriy also added the abiltiy to cycle through the sort fields in
           reverse order.
         Fixes:
         * Thanks to Michael Henry for supplying a patch that allows
           bufexplorer to be opened even when there is one buffer or less.
         * Thanks to Godefroid Chapelle for supplying a patch that fixed
           MRU sort order after loading a session.
7.2.2  - Fixes:
         * Thanks to David L. Dight for spotting and fixing an issue when
           using ctrl^. bufexplorer would incorrectly handle the previous
           buffer so that when ctrl^ was pressed the incorrect file was opened.
7.2.1  - Fixes:
         * Thanks to Dimitar for spotting and fixing a feature that was
           inadvertently left out of the previous version. The feature was
           when bufexplorer was used together with WinManager, you could use
           the tab key to open a buffer in a split window.
7.2.0  - Enhancements:
         * For all those missing the \bs and \bv commands, these have now
           returned. Thanks to Phil O'Connell for asking for the return of
           these missing features and helping test out this version.
         Fixes:
         * Fixed problem with the bufExplorerFindActive code not working
           correctly.
         * Fixed an incompatibility between bufexplorer and netrw that caused
           buffers to be incorrectly removed from the MRU list.
7.1.7  - Fixes:
         * TaCahiroy fixed several issues related to opening a buffer in a
           tab.
7.1.6  - Fixes:
         * Removed ff=unix from modeline in bufexplorer.txt. Found by Bill
           McCarthy.
7.1.5  - Fixes:
         * Could not open unnamed buffers. Fixed by TaCahiroy.
7.1.4  - Fixes:
         * Sometimes when a file's path has 'white space' in it, extra buffers
           would be created containing each piece of the path. i.e:
           opening c:\document and settings\test.txt would create a buffer
           named "and" and a buffer named "Documents". This was reported and
           fixed by TaCa Yoss.
7.1.3  - Fixes:
         * Added code to allow only one instance of the plugin to run at a
           time. Thanks Dennis Hostetler.
7.1.2  - Fixes:
         * Fixed a jumplist issue spotted by JiangJun. I overlooked the
           'jumplist' and with a couple calls to 'keepjumps', everything is
           fine again.
         * Went back to just having a plugin file, no autoload file. By having
           the autoload, WinManager was no longer working and without really
           digging into the cause, it was easier to go back to using just a
           plugin file.
7.1.1  - Fixes:
         * A problem spotted by Thomas Arendsen Hein.
           When running Vim (7.1.94), error E493 was being thrown.
         Enhancements:
         * Added 'D' for 'delete' buffer as the 'd' command was a 'wipe'
           buffer.
7.1.0  - Another 'major' update, some by Dave Larson, some by me.
         * Making use of 'autoload' now to make the plugin load quicker.
         * Removed '\bs' and '\bv'. These are now controlled by the user. The
           user can issue a ':sp' or ':vs' to create a horizontal or vertical
           split window and then issue a '\be'
         * Added handling of tabs.
7.0.17 - Fixed issue with 'drop' command.
         Various enhancements and improvements.
7.0.16 - Fixed issue reported by Liu Jiaping on non Windows systems, which was
         ...
         Open file1, open file2, modify file1, open bufexplorer, you get the
         following error:

         --------8<--------
         Error detected while processing function
         <SNR>14_StartBufExplorer..<SNR>14_SplitOpen:
         line    4:
         E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)

         But the worse thing is, when I want to save the current buffer and
         type ':w', I get another error message:
         E382: Cannot write, 'buftype' option is set
         --------8<--------

7.0.15 - Thanks to Mark Smithfield for suggesting bufexplorer needed to handle
         the ':args' command.
7.0.14 - Thanks to Randall Hansen for removing the requirement of terminal
         versions to be recompiled with 'gui' support so the 'drop' command
         would work. The 'drop' command is really not needed in terminal
         versions.
7.0.13 - Fixed integration with WinManager.
         Thanks to Dave Eggum for another update.
           - Fix: The detailed help didn't display the mapping for toggling
                  the split type, even though the split type is displayed.
           - Fixed incorrect description in the detailed help for toggling
             relative or full paths.
           - Deprecated s:ExtractBufferNbr(). Vim's str2nr() does the same
             thing.
           - Created a s:Set() function that sets a variable only if it hasn't
             already been defined. It's useful for initializing all those
             default settings.
           - Removed checks for repetitive command definitions. They were
             unnecessary.
           - Made the help highlighting a little more fancy.
           - Minor reverse compatibility issue: Changed ambiguous setting
             names to be more descriptive of what they do (also makes the code
             easier to follow):
               Changed bufExplorerSortDirection to bufExplorerReverseSort
               Changed bufExplorerSplitType to bufExplorerSplitVertical
               Changed bufExplorerOpenMode to bufExplorerUseCurrentWindow
           - When the BufExplorer window closes, all the file-local marks are
             now deleted. This may have the benefit of cleaning up some of the
             jumplist.
           - Changed the name of the parameter for StartBufExplorer from
             "split" to "open". The parameter is a string which specifies how
             the buffer will be open, not if it is split or not.
           - Deprecated DoAnyMoreBuffersExist() - it is a one line function
             only used in one spot.
           - Created four functions (SplitOpen(), RebuildBufferList(),
             UpdateHelpStatus() and ReSortListing()) all with one purpose - to
             reduce repeated code.
           - Changed the name of AddHeader() to CreateHelp() to be more
             descriptive of what it does. It now returns an array instead of
             updating the window directly. This has the benefit of making the
             code more efficient since the text the function returns is used a
             little differently in the two places the function is called.
         - Other minor simplifications.
7.0.12 - MAJOR Update.
         This version will ONLY run with Vim version 7.0 or greater.
         Dave Eggum has made some 'significant' updates to this latest
         version:
           - Added BufExplorerGetAltBuf() global function to be used in the
             user抯 rulerformat.
           - Added g:bufExplorerSplitRight option.
           - Added g:bufExplorerShowRelativePath option with mapping.
           - Added current line highlighting.
           - The split type can now be changed whether bufexplorer is opened
             in split mode or not.
           - Various major and minor bug fixes and speed improvements.
           - Sort by extension.
         Other improvements/changes:
           - Changed the help key from '?' to <F1> to be more 'standard'.
           - Fixed splitting of vertical bufexplorer window.
         Hopefully I have not forgot something :)
7.0.11 - Fixed a couple of highlighting bugs, reported by David Eggum. He also
         changed passive voice to active on a couple of warning messages.
7.0.10 - Fixed bug report by Xiangjiang Ma. If the 'ssl' option is set,
         the slash character used when displaying the path was incorrect.
7.0.9  - Martin Grenfell found and eliminated an annoying bug in the
         bufexplorer/winmanager integration. The bug was were an
         annoying message would be displayed when a window was split or
         a new file was opened in a new window. Thanks Martin!
7.0.8  - Thanks to Mike Li for catching a bug in the WinManager integration.
         The bug was related to the incorrect displaying of the buffer
         explorer's window title.
7.0.7  - Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar for adding a new enhancement. This
         enhancement allows the user to press 'S', that is capital S, which
         will open the buffer under the cursor in a newly created split
         window.
7.0.6  - Thanks to Larry Zhang for finding a bug in the "split" buffer code.
         If you force set g:bufExplorerSplitType='v' in your vimrc, and if you
         tried to do a \bs to split the bufexplorer window, it would always
         split horizontal, not vertical. He also found that I had a typeo in
         that the variable g:bufExplorerSplitVertSize was all lower case in
         the documentation which was incorrect.
7.0.5  - Thanks to Mun Johl for pointing out a bug that if a buffer was
         modified, the '+' was not showing up correctly.
7.0.4  - Fixed a problem discovered first by Xiangjiang Ma. Well since I've
         been using vim 7.0 and not 6.3, I started using a function (getftype)
         that is not in 6.3. So for backward compatibility, I conditionaly use
         this function now.  Thus, the g:bufExplorerShowDirectories feature is
         only available when using vim 7.0 and above.
7.0.3  - Thanks to Erwin Waterlander for finding a problem when the last
         buffer was deleted. This issue got me to rewrite the buffer display
         logic (which I've wanted to do for sometime now).
         Also great thanks to Dave Eggum for coming up with idea for
         g:bufExplorerShowDirectories. Read the above information about this
         feature.
7.0.2  - Thanks to Thomas Arendsen Hein for finding a problem when a user
         has the default help turned off and then brought up the explorer. An
         E493 would be displayed.
7.0.1  - Thanks to Erwin Waterlander for finding a couple problems.
         The first problem allowed a modified buffer to be deleted.  Opps! The
         second problem occurred when several files were opened, BufExplorer
         was started, the current buffer was deleted using the 'd' option, and
         then BufExplorer was exited. The deleted buffer was still visible
         while it is not in the buffers list. Opps again!
7.0.0  - Thanks to Shankar R. for suggesting to add the ability to set
         the fixed width (g:bufExplorerSplitVertSize) of a new window
         when opening bufexplorer vertically and fixed height
         (g:bufExplorerSplitHorzSize) of a new window when opening
         bufexplorer horizontally. By default, the windows are normally
         split to use half the existing width or height.
6.3.0  - Added keepjumps so that the jumps list would not get cluttered with
         bufexplorer related stuff.
6.2.3  - Thanks to Jay Logan for finding a bug in the vertical split position
         of the code. When selecting that the window was to be split
         vertically by doing a '\bv', from then on, all splits, i.e. '\bs',
         were split vertically, even though g:bufExplorerSplitType was not set
         to 'v'.
6.2.2  - Thanks to Patrik Modesto for adding a small improvement. For some
         reason his bufexplorer window was always showing up folded. He added
         'setlocal nofoldenable' and it was fixed.
6.2.1  - Thanks goes out to Takashi Matsuo for added the 'fullPath' sorting
         logic and option.
6.2.0  - Thanks goes out to Simon Johann-Ganter for spotting and fixing a
         problem in that the last search pattern is overridden by the search
         pattern for blank lines.
6.1.6  - Thanks to Artem Chuprina for finding a pesky bug that has been around
         for sometime now. The <esc> key mapping was causing the buffer
         explored to close prematurely when vim was run in an xterm. The <esc>
         key mapping is now removed.
6.1.5  - Thanks to Khorev Sergey. Added option to show default help or not.
6.1.4  - Thanks goes out to Valery Kondakoff for suggesting the addition of
         setlocal nonumber and foldcolumn=0. This allows for line numbering
         and folding to be turned off temporarily while in the explorer.
6.1.3  - Added folding. Did some code cleanup. Added the ability to force the
         newly split window to be temporarily vertical, which was suggested by
         Thomas Glanzmann.
6.1.2  - Now pressing the <esc> key will quit, just like 'q'.
         Added folds to hide winmanager configuration.
         If anyone had the 'C' option in their cpoptions they would receive
         a E10 error on startup of BufExplorer. cpo is now saved, updated and
         restored. Thanks to Charles E Campbell, Jr.
         Attempted to make sure there can only be one BufExplorer window open
         at a time.
6.1.1  - Thanks to Brian D. Goodwin for adding toupper to FileNameCmp. This
         way buffers sorted by name will be in the correct order regardless of
         case.
6.0.16 - Thanks to Andre Pang for the original patch/idea to get bufexplorer
         to work in insertmode/modeless mode (evim). Added Initialize
         and Cleanup autocommands to handle commands that need to be
         performed when starting or leaving bufexplorer.
6.0.15 - Srinath Avadhanulax added a patch for winmanager.vim.
6.0.14 - Fix a few more bug that I thought I already had fixed. Thanks
         to Eric Bloodworth for adding 'Open Mode/Edit in Place'. Added
         vertical splitting.
6.0.13 - Thanks to Charles E Campbell, Jr. for pointing out some embarrassing
         typos that I had in the documentation. I guess I need to run
         the spell checker more :o)
6.0.12 - Thanks to Madoka Machitani, for the tip on adding the augroup command
         around the MRUList autocommands.
6.0.11 - Fixed bug report by Xiangjiang Ma. '"=' was being added to the
         search history which messed up hlsearch.
6.0.10 - Added the necessary hooks so that the Srinath Avadhanula's
         winmanager.vim script could more easily integrate with this script.
         Tried to improve performance.
6.0.9  - Added MRU (Most Recently Used) sort ordering.
6.0.8  - Was not resetting the showcmd command correctly.
         Added nifty help file.
6.0.7  - Thanks to Brett Carlane for some great enhancements. Some are added,
         some are not, yet. Added highlighting of current and alternate
         filenames. Added splitting of path/filename toggle. Reworked
         ShowBuffers().
         Changed my email address.
6.0.6  - Copyright notice added. Needed this so that it could be distributed
         with Debian Linux. Fixed problem with the SortListing() function
         failing when there was only one buffer to display.
6.0.5  - Fixed problems reported by David Pascoe, in that you where unable to
         hit 'd' on a buffer that belonged to a files that no longer existed
         and that the 'yank' buffer was being overridden by the help text when
         the bufexplorer was opened.
6.0.4  - Thanks to Charles Campbell, Jr. for making this plugin more plugin
         *compliant*, adding default keymappings of <Leader>be and <Leader>bs
         as well as fixing the 'w:sortDirLabel not being defined' bug.
6.0.3  - Added sorting capabilities. Sort taken from explorer.vim.
6.0.2  - Can't remember. (2001-07-25)
6.0.1  - Initial release.

Credit must go out to Bram Moolenaar and all the Vim developers for
making the world's best editor (IMHO). I also want to thank everyone who
helped and gave me suggestions. I wouldn't want to leave anyone out so I
won't list names.
